        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          We are a team of third-year Electronics and Computer Science students from V.E.S. Institute of Technology, passionate about cybersecurity and data science. This project—titled <strong>“Enhancing Investigation Efficiency”</strong>—is developed as part of our mini-project for the subject Data Warehousing & Mining. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our solution focuses on automating cybercrime investigation using machine learning algorithms and interactive data visualizations. By combining behavioral analytics with network traffic analysis, we’ve built a system that detects anomalies, scores threats, and presents actionable insights through a live dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is integrated with tools like Google Sheets, Google Colab, and Tableau to support real-time data processing, visualization, and reporting—helping investigators respond to threats faster and with greater accuracy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-based threat scoring using supervised ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)</li>
          <li>Real-time dummy data generation to simulate dynamic environments</li>
          <li>Interactive Tableau dashboards with filters, KPIs, and trend analysis</li>
          <li>Exportable investigation reports in PDF, PPT, and image formats</li>
          <li>Hosted dashboard for seamless investigator access and analysis</li>
        </ul>
